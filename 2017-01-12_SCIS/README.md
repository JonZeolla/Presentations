I started putting these materials in my presentation but it became too many pages of links, so I moved it here.

#### Programming
* Java
  * If you want to do big data stuff, you really should know some Java.  It's very predominent.
  * There are **so** many tutorials available online for free, but just for fun, [here's one explicitly](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).
* Python

    * Did you know that you can include R in Python via [rpy2](http://rpy2.bitbucket.org/)?
    * Try out [this brief intro](https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) if you're new to the language.
    * For those of you who love Python and Spark, check out [PySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html).
    * [TF Learn](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn) (previously SkFlow) is a simplified interface for TensorFlow, to get people started on predictive analytics and data mining.
* R
  * Development Environment
    * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is *pretty much* your only option
  * Other
    * Did you know that you can include Python in R via [rJython](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJython/index.html)?
    * Try out [this brief intro](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf) if you're new to the language.
    * For those of you who love R and Spark, check out [SparkR](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html).
* Apache Zeppelin
  * Zeppelin gets an honorable mention here.  It is a "A web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics."  You really should [check it out](https://zeppelin.apache.org/).
